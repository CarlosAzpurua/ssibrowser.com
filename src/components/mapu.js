                <p>A lot of people care about our natural environment. However, information is scattered, like-minded communities disconnected from each other, and many of us don't know where to start. Global warming is a real threat, but humans make it worse by continuing the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. The Tyron SSI Protocol is thriving towards connecting like-minded people that want to protect nature and its ecosystems.</p>
                <p><i>.Mapu</i> will be the domain name for communities that organize campaigns to aid natural and human-made disasters - so that people can send donations peer-to-peer and self-organize.</p>
                <p>Thousands of hectares got <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/democraciaabierta/patagonia-argentina-mining-indigenous-politics-fire/">intentionally burnt in Patagonia in March 2021</a>, including national parks:</p>
                <span class="image main"><img src={incendios_chubut} alt=""/></span>
                <p>Similar fires happened in Australia and the Amazon, killing everything in their paths. In the last year:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>More than 6,000,000 hectares burnt in Australia.</li>
                    <li>NASA satellites detected about 1.4 million anomalies in the southern Amazon, compared to 1.1 million in 2019. In the Pantanal along the border of Brazil, Paraguay, and Bolivia fires destroyed 4.4 million in 2020, about 28% of the Pantanal.</li>
                    <li>In Chubut province, Argentina, fires burnt more than 500 houses along seven towns - including areas in national parks.</li>
                </ul>
                <p> Many of us may come from different places, but we share moral values. Blockchain technologies can help us distribute information that cannot get censored and donate crypto assets peer-to-peer - we can protect nature and future generations.</p>

                <p>Change is coming, and we see it reflected in kids and young generations. Likewise, indigenous people have that respect for nature internalized in their cultures. But they were colonized and deprived of that. For example, the Mapuche people of North Patagonia got attacked by the Argentinian and Chilean states in the late 19th century in one of the biggest genocides of modern history. But we are still here.</p>

                <p>In the Mapuzungun language, <i>mapu</i> means earth/soil/ground - and <i>che</i> means people. Mapuche's vision is the <i>Kvme Felen</i>, or "good living", focused on building a society more just and with biodiversity - learning from the past and present to build a better future.</p>
