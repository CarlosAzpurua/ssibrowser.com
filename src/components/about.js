				<p>The word <i>tyron</i> derives from the Greek <i>turannos</i> that means sovereign, and the purpose of the Tyron Self-Sovereign Identity Protocol is to give people sovereignty over their data. Sovereignty to empower our world by protecting nature and helping each other in times of need, selflessly.</p>
				<h3 class="major">Self-sovereign identity (SSI)</h3>
				<p>Self-sovereign identity enables people to manage their digital, online identities - proving who they are without a middleman, by anchoring <Link to="/did">decentralized identifiers</Link> on blockchain networks as a shared root of trust.</p>
				<p>Tyron self-sovereign identities will be able to share uncensorable information such as articles and encrypted messages, as well as make donations to aid natural and human-made disasters that endanger our planet's ecosystems.</p>
