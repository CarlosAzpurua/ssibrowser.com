Although, only 35% of the tokens will be ever available to sell to investors. The remaining 65% will get managed by Tyron Pungtas, an open organization to become a  Community Interest Company based in the United Kingdom, Europe. However, these profits will get yearly invested in a global sustainable project voted out by <Link to="/defi">$TYRON</Link> token holders.</p>
